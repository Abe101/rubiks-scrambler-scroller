# rubiks-scrambler-scroller (WIP)

I have mostly been using the Ruwix's rubiks-scrambler page for my scrambles but I saw that even though I have the option to generate more scrambles I would still have to scroll to each of them. I just want a page that generates scrambles and keeps scrolling itself. I am too lazy to scroll the end of the page every time and scroll back to top to generate more scrolls. So I would rather just do this.

Its still a work in progress because I am lazy and for a problem to occur in my code it would take days or weeks to solve which I know would take a hardly a day or two to solve.
