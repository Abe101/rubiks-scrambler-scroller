# rubiks-scrambler-scroller

I have mostly been using the Ruwix's rubiks-scrambler page for my scrambles but I saw that even though I have the option to generate more scrambles I would still have to scroll to each of them. I just want a page that generates scrambles and keeps scrolling itself. I am too lazy to scroll the end of the page every time and scroll back to top to generate more scrolls. So I would rather just do this.
